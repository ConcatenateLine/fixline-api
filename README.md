# üé´ FixLine-API

A modular, multi-tenant backend for managing support tickets across organizations. Built with NestJS and GraphQL, designed for scalable SaaS deployment, secure tenant isolation, and seamless integration with decoupled frontend clients.

---

## üì¶ Architecture Overview

- **Framework**: NestJS (TypeScript)
- **API Layer**: GraphQL (Apollo Server)
- **Design**: Modular structure with folders for `auth`, `tenants`, `tickets`, `users`, `comments`, etc.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (recommended), using Prisma or TypeORM
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Scoped access via `tenant_id`, injected into GraphQL context
- **Auth**: JWT-based authentication with tenant-aware role-based access control
- **Billing**: Optional Stripe integration for subscription tiers
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-tenant API quotas (e.g., ticket creation, agent count)
- **Frontend**: Decoupled clients
- **Docs**: GraphQL schema introspection + optional Swagger for REST fallback

## üßë‚Äçüíº Role Aggregates & Access Model

FixLine supports scoped user roles per tenant, enabling fine-grained access control and modular service isolation.

### üîê Supported Roles

| Role    | Description                                     | Permissions Summary                          | Create By     |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| ADMIN   | Full operational control over tenant            | Manage users, tickets, and tenant settings   | SYSTEM        |
| MANAGER | Oversees ticket workflows and agent assignments | Assign tickets, view reports, manage agents  | ADMIN         |
| AGENT   | Handles assigned tickets                        | View/edit tickets, limited user visibility   | MANAGER/ADMIN |
| VIEWER  | Read-only access to tenant data                 | Create/view tickets, limited user visibility | MANAGER/ADMIN |
| GUEST   | Temporary or limited access                     | View public info, no ticket interaction      | ANY           |

### üßÆ Role Aggregates

Roles are aggregated per tenant, allowing users to hold different roles across multiple tenants.

```typescript
// Example: User with multiple tenant roles
{
  id: "user_123",
  memberships: [
    { tenantId: "acme", role: "ADMIN" },
    { tenantId: "globex", role: "AGENT" },
    { tenantId: "umbrella", role: "GUEST" }
  ]
}
```

### üß™ Testing & Seed Data

The seed script includes sample users with varied role aggregates to support testing of:

- Role-based guards and GraphQL resolvers
- Multi-tenant UI flows and permission checks
- Onboarding scenarios with scoped access
